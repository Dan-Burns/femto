!!! warning
    The ATM implementation was recently updated to make use of the new `ATMForce` shipped with OpenMM 8.1. While
    every effort was made to ensure correctness, this was a major change that is still being tested and there may
    be bugs. Please report any issues you encounter.

    Further, the default protocols selected for the ATM and SepTop methods are still being tested and optimized, and may
    not be optimal. It is recommended that you run a few test calculations to ensure that the results are reasonable.
